## 2. Project Title: Java URL Shortener
The Java URL Shortener is a simple yet effective tool for converting long URLs into concise and shareable short URLs. This project provides two main features: the ability to generate a short URL from an integer ID and the capability to retrieve the original integer ID from a short URL. The algorithm uses a custom base-62 encoding, utilizing a character set derived from a provided URL, such as "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/". The project demonstrates the principles of URL shortening and base conversion, making it a valuable learning resource for those interested in Java programming and algorithmic techniques.
